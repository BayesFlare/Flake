\section{Introduction}
Many inference problems have the following structure. There is some unknown
number, $N$, of objects in a region. Each of the $N$ objects has a property
$x$, which may be a single scalar value (for example, a mass), or a set of
values (e.g. a position and a mass).

We would like to assign a prior to the objects' properties $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^N$.
Since $N$ may be large, it is usually easier to assign an ``interim prior''
conditional on some hyperparameters $\alpha$, and then assign a prior to
$\alpha$. This kind of model is usually called {\it hierarchical}.

The prior for $N$, $\alpha$, and $\{x_i\}$ is usually factorised
in the following way:

\begin{eqnarray}
p(N, \alpha, \{x_i\}) &=& p(N) p(\alpha | N) p(\{x_i\} | \alpha, N) \\
&=& p(N) p(\alpha) \prod_{i=1}^N p(\{x_i\} | \alpha).
\end{eqnarray}

Here we have assumed the priors for $N$ and $\alpha$ are independent, and
the interim prior for $\{x_i\}$ is iid and does not depend on $N$.
